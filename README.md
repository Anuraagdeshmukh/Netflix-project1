i made a Netflix home page project by using HTML & CSS

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
Poster Display: Displays movie/show posters similar to the actual Netflix layout.

How to Run:
To view this project, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.

Demo:
Include screenshots or GIFs showcasing the project's appearance and functionality.

Future Improvements:
Functionality: Incorporate JavaScript for interactive elements (e.g., clickable posters).
Backend Integration: Connect with a backend service to fetch real movie data.
Enhanced Responsiveness: Further optimize for various devices and resolutions.
Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or use this as a reference for learning HTML and CSS!
